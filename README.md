# 🚀 Distributed Task Management System

This project is a **cloud-based simulation** that manages tasks across distributed virtual machines (VMs). It incorporates concepts of cloud computing, multithreading, and virtual disk storage to create a robust system for task management.

## 🌟 Features
- ✅ Add, update, delete, and retrieve tasks for each VM.
- 💾 Persistent task storage using a simulated virtual disk.
- 🧠 Dual-core CPU simulation for parallel task processing.
- 🌐 Commands processed via a centralized cloud system.
- 🔍 Retrieve processed tasks from both memory and virtual disk.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- 🐍 **Python**: Programming language.
- 🧱 **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: For modular and scalable design.
- ⚙️ **Multithreading**: To simulate CPU cores.
- 📂 **File-based Storage**: To simulate virtual disk operations.

## 📖 How It Works
1. **💻 Client Commands**: Commands are issued through the `client.py` script.
2. **☁️ Cloud Processing**: Commands are processed by the `cloud.py` module and routed to the appropriate VM.
3. **📂 Task Storage**: Tasks are processed and stored in both memory and a virtual disk.


## 📝 Commands
- ➕ Add a Task:
  ```bash
  python client.py add-task <vm_id> <task_data> <task_id>

- 📋 List Tasks:
  ```bash
  python client.py list-tasks <vm_id>

- ❌ Delete a Task:
  ```bash
  python client.py delete-task <vm_id> <task_id>

- ✏️ Update a Task:
  ```bash
  python client.py update-task <vm_id> <task_id> <new_data>

- 🧐 Get Processed Tasks:
  ```bash
  python client.py get-processed-tasks <vm_id>

- 📂 List All Tasks (Stored on Disk):
  ```bash
  python client.py list-all-tasks <vm_id>

- 🧹 Clear Disk:
  ```bash
  python client.py clear-disk <vm_id>
